# Versioning

ETG uses semantic versioning at the spec level:

- **Major**: backward incompatible changes to artifacts or verification rules
- **Minor**: backward compatible additions (new optional fields, new error codes)
- **Patch**: editorial fixes and clarifications

## Stability
A version is considered stable when tagged as a GitHub release.

## Deprecations
Deprecations MUST be announced in a minor release before removal in a major release.
